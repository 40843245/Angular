# `upper-camel case` naming style to `hyphen-delimiter word` naming style

Here is a rule about reflection from `upper-camel case` naming style to `hyphen-delimiter words` naming style.

a. lowercase it for first letter.

b. After that, for all uppercase letter, replace it to a hypen sign (i.e. `-`) followed by its corresponding lowercase.

For example, 

`PageNotFound` will be `pageNotFound` after step a. 

Then it will be `page-not-found` after b.
